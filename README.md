# -Python-January-2019-US-Flights

Project impetus: This project and the sourced data was selected due to an ongoing interest in the airline sector and understanding a healthier airline travel enviornment. 
With the current market seeing a significant increase in delays and cancellations, post covid restrictions, being able to understand where we came from and how travel worked in a less taxed system is the goal.

Sourcing details:

The Kaggle project took data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics
Over 500,000 records
 Extracted January of 2019
 Includes details on: 
- Departure time and location

Limitations:
Lack of time data, the data for the 500,000 flights only covers 31 days of the year, making time the limiting factor.
Data is from 2019 which is both distant from present day and just before the changes that occurred due to Covid 19.
